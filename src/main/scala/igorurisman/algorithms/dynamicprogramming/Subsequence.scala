  /**
   * Compute the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence of a given sequence S1,S2,...,Sn.
   *
   * The momo structure is an Int array of the same length as the input sequence, which we initialize
   * with all 1s. At the end of the algorithm, Memo(i) will contain the length of the longest increasing
   * subsequence of the first i<=n characters S1,...,Si of the given sequence.
   *
   * This algorithm has running time complexity O(nÂ²). There's an optimization of this algorithm that is
   * (typically) faster, offered by Hunt and Szymanski in 1977, as described in
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence
